#Arithmetic operators

#consider
a = 10
b = 20


#Addition
a + b

#subtraction
a - b

#Multiplication
a * b

#division 
a/b

#Remove decimal (Floor Divison)
a//b
5.0//2
-11//3

#Modules
b % a


#exponential
a**b


#Comparision Operator

#It gives in bool values

a == b

a != b
 
a > b

a >= b

a <= b

#Assignment Operators

# c = c+b
c += b 

# c= c-b
c -= b

#c = c*a
c *= b

#c = c/a
